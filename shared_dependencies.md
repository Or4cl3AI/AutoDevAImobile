Shared Dependencies:

1. Android SDK: All the Java files and XML files will share the Android SDK as a dependency for the basic Android functionality.

2. MainActivity: All the Java classes will likely interact with MainActivity.java, as it is the entry point of the application.

3. AIAgent: This class is the main AI agent and will be used by other classes like MainActivity, NLPProcessor, InternetAccess, PersonalityMemory, CodeGenerator, and UserInteraction.

4. NLPProcessor: This class will be used by AIAgent for natural language processing.

5. InternetAccess: This class will be used by AIAgent for accessing and interacting with the internet.

6. PersonalityMemory: This class will be used by AIAgent for developing its own personality and memory.

7. CodeGenerator: This class will be used by AIAgent for generating code.

8. ProgrammingKnowledge: This class will be used by CodeGenerator for knowledge of programming languages and libraries.

9. UserInteraction: This class will be used by MainActivity and AIAgent for user interaction.

10. activity_main.xml: This layout file will be used by MainActivity.java for the user interface.

11. strings.xml: This file will be used by activity_main.xml and all Java classes for string resources.

12. AndroidManifest.xml: All the Java classes will be registered in this file.

13. build.gradle: This file will contain all the dependencies used in the project, which will be shared by all the Java classes.

14. Function Names: Functions like onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), onDestroy() from the Android lifecycle will be shared across all Java classes.

15. Message Names: Toast messages and Log messages will be shared across all Java classes.

16. ID Names: All the ID names of the elements in the activity_main.xml layout file will be shared across MainActivity.java and UserInteraction.java.

17. Exported Variables: Variables like AI_AGENT, NLP_PROCESSOR, INTERNET_ACCESS, PERSONALITY_MEMORY, CODE_GENERATOR, PROGRAMMING_KNOWLEDGE, USER_INTERACTION will be shared across multiple Java classes.
